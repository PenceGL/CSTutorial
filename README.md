## Core Systems Tutorial Repository

This is the code repository for the Core Systems (Items, Interaction, and Inventory) video tutorial series for Unreal Engine 5 C++. The series playlist can be found at the following link:

Any assets such as blueprints, data tables, etc. created specifically for the project 
are versioned and are located at Content/CSTutorial.

External content packages will not be added to version control due to their size.
However, I will never add a package to this project that is not free.

### List of external packages:
* Infinity Blade: Props - https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/infinity-blade-props
