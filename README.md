## Core Systems Tutorial Repository

This is the code repository for the Core Systems Tutorial (Items, Interaction, and Inventory).

Any assets such as blueprints, data tables, etc. created specifically for the project 
are versioned and are located at Content/CSTutorial.

External content packages will not be added to version control due to their size.
However, I will never add a package to this project that is not free.

### List of external packages:
* Infinity Blade: Props - https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/infinity-blade-props
